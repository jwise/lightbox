I decided that instead of doing writing about the last week or so, I'd let a
handful of photos that I took tell the story.  This photoset is different
from my normal in a handful of ways -- the most obvious, I think, is that
the vast majority of these were shot with my cell phone, rather than with a
DSC!  "Quality" and "composition" were not necessarily the #1 things that I
tried to achieve with many of these.  The vast majority of these are
completely unedited.<br> <br>

In many respects, this is much less of a photoset than a visual blog entry. 
Below are a few moments from my life recently that I wanted to share with
you.  For some of them, I had the feeling of a deep, visceral, gritty
reality -- I'm not sure how else to convey it.  So, without further ado,
here they are.<br> <br>

I hope you enjoy.
