<b><i>A day in the backcountry</i></b><br>

<div class="words">

There are three kinds of fun in the world.  The first kind of fun, aptly
named, is Type I Fun: while you're doing it, it's fun, and you go back and
look back at it, and it was fun.  The third kind is Type III Fun: you do it,
and it's not fun.  You look back on it, and it wasn't fun.<br> <br>

But the one in the middle is a little different.  You're doing it.  It's not
fun.  It's a sufferfest.  Eventually, you get home.  You look back on your
day.  (Maybe it takes a little while before you get to this step.) Out of
nowhere, you remember it, and it was fun!  <br> <br>

This is a set of photos from a day firmly filled with Type II Fun.
